Response to Exercise 1:
	The sys_getpid() will return the correct value because
	interrupt function save the pid into current process(i)'s 
	register struct before calling schedule function. In the
	future, when the process i restart, it first load the pid
	from process i's register struct's eax, which is already
	saved and should not be modified when all other processes
	were running.

Response to Exercise 2:
	do_fork first find a state in array that have state of 
	P_EMPTY, then copy the register struct and stack to the 
	child's process. after that, the function changes state
	of child's process from P_EMPTY to P_RUNNABLE.
	when the process restart, it will first load pid from
	process's eax register. The return value of child process
	should be zero and parent's process should return child's
	pid; therefore, the child's eax should set to zero.
	do_fork(); copy_stack();

Response to Exercise 3:
	The process_t struct has a new element waitPID which holds
	the pid of the process it is waiting for. after the current
	process set to P_BLOCK, everytime schedule try to restart
	current process will first check the status of the process
	it is waiting. If that process is in P_ZOMBIE state, save
	the exist status of the process and restart current process.
	interrupt(); schedule();

Response to Exercise 4:
	Set the state of process to empty when process is exited.
	interrupt(); schedule();
